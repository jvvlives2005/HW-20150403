 *Character Distributions

 Create a class to calculate the distribution of characters in the contents of a text file.
 Your class called DistributionCalculator should implement a method calculate(File textFile) which accepts as input a Text file.
 It reads the contents of the file and returns an ArrayList which contains the distribution/percentage of characters (a-z) in
 the text file. You should lowercase lines before you do the calculation. Call the calculate method from main and print the
 distribution. You can ignore characters which do not belong in the range(a-z) for doing your calculation. Your program's
 output should look something like:
 *

//Note: I am confused with this too!

public class DistributionCalculator
{
    public static File calculate(File textFile){
        //inout a textfile
    //}

    //an array list is made like ArrayList<Percent> alphabets
    //public static void main(String[] args){
    //something.getCalulate;

}
